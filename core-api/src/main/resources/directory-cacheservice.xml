    Cache configuration
    ===================

    The following attributes are required.

    name:
    Sets the name of the cache. This is used to identify the cache. It must be unique.

    maxElementsInMemory:
    Sets the maximum number of objects that will be created in memory

    maxElementsOnDisk:
    Sets the maximum number of objects that will be maintained in the DiskStore
    The default value is zero, meaning unlimited.

    eternal:
    Sets whether elements are eternal. If eternal,  timeouts are ignored and the
    element is never expired.

    overflowToDisk:
    Sets whether elements can overflow to disk when the memory store
    has reached the maxInMemory limit.

    The following attributes and elements are optional.

    timeToIdleSeconds:
    Sets the time to idle for an element before it expires.
    i.e. The maximum amount of time between accesses before an element expires
    Is only used if the element is not eternal.
    Optional attribute. A value of 0 means that an Element can idle for infinity.
    The default value is 0.

    timeToLiveSeconds:
    Sets the time to live for an element before it expires.
    i.e. The maximum time between creation time and when an element expires.
    Is only used if the element is not eternal.
    Optional attribute. A value of 0 means that and Element can live for infinity.
    The default value is 0.

    diskPersistent:
    Whether the disk store persists between restarts of the Virtual Machine.
    The default value is false.

    diskExpiryThreadIntervalSeconds:
    The number of seconds between runs of the disk expiry thread. The default value
    is 120 seconds.

    diskSpoolBufferSizeMB:
    This is the size to allocate the DiskStore for a spool buffer. Writes are made
    to this area and then asynchronously written to disk. The default size is 30MB.
    Each spool buffer is used only by its cache. If you get OutOfMemory errors consider
    lowering this value. To improve DiskStore performance consider increasing it. Trace level
    logging in the DiskStore will show if put back ups are occurring.

    clearOnFlush:
    whether the MemoryStore should be cleared when flush() is called on the cache.
    By default, this is true i.e. the MemoryStore is cleared.

    memoryStoreEvictionPolicy:
    Policy would be enforced upon reaching the maxElementsInMemory limit. Default
    policy is Least Recently Used (specified as LRU). Other policies available -
    First In First Out (specified as FIFO) and Less Frequently Used
    (specified as LFU)
-->
	<!-- Mandatory Default Cache configuration. These settings will be applied 
		to caches created programmtically using CacheManager.add(String cacheName). 
		The defaultCache has an implicit name "default" which is a reserved cache 
		name. -->
		
	<defaultCache maxElementsInMemory="0" eternal="false"
		overflowToDisk="false" timeToIdleSeconds="1200" timeToLiveSeconds="1200">
	</defaultCache>

	<!-- Sample cache named sampleCache1 This cache contains a maximum in memory 
		of 10000 elements, and will expire an element if it is idle for more than 
		5 minutes and lives for more than 10 minutes. If there are more than 10000 
		elements it will overflow to the disk cache, which in this configuration 
		will go to wherever java.io.tmp is defined on your system. On a standard 
		Linux system this will be /tmp" -->
		<!-- 
		Note: set the 'overflowToDisk' flag always to 'true'.
		The groups information is only read once during startup hence 
		we need to retain this info forever available in the cache
		as long as the server is running, so hinting the cache to store
		on disk is needed to swap the data if it is too much to hold in memory -->
	<cache name="groupCache" 
	       maxElementsInMemory="10000"
		   eternal="false" 
		   overflowToDisk="true"
		   diskSpoolBufferSizeMB="20"
		   timeToIdleSeconds="300"
		   timeToLiveSeconds="600"

		   diskPersistent="false" />
    
    <cache name="dnCache" 
	       maxElementsInMemory="10000"
		   eternal="false" 
		   overflowToDisk="false"
		   diskSpoolBufferSizeMB="20"
		   timeToIdleSeconds="300"
		   timeToLiveSeconds="600"

		   diskPersistent="false" />

   <!-- Kerberos replay cache
      NOTE1: keep the maxElementsInMemory as low as possible to avoid wasting memory
      Cause the elements present in the cache won't be removed dynamically even after their TTL
      expires. For a good explanation see http://forums.terracotta.org/forums/posts/list/4126.page
      
      NOTE2: We don't use the standard eviction policies like LFU or LRU rather we use a custom eviction
             policy based on the value of clockskew setting. The default value of clokcskew is 5 minutes,
             which is also set for the TTL and TTI values of cache config
             
      So what we do here is enable the overflowToDisk flag and then let the disk store be cleaned
      periodically based on diskExpiryThreadIntervalSeconds

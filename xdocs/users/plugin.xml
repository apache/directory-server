      <p>
        Currently the primary function of the plugin is to generates Eve class
        files for OpenLDAP schemas. These class files contain hard coded schema
        objects representing those found in the OpenLDAP files.  Why bother you
        may ask?  There are a few reasons for this:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Compiled hard coded files load into the server really fast in theory.
        </li>
        <li>
          Published schemas never really change so why do they need to be in a
          human readable form.
        </li>
        <li>
          Eventually, schema changes made through LDAP will be preserved through
          restarts.
        </li>
        <li>
          Extra code generation phase is not that hard with a plugin tool.
        </li>
        <li>
          Schema verification can occur before deploying schemas into the
          server.
        </li>
        <li>
          This was really easy for now but if people don't like it we can
          change it.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <section name="How to Integrate">
      <p>
        Ok so you want to use the plugin to generate classes for your own
        schema.  Here's a step wise process you can follow to do that using
        maven:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Place your schema files (i.e. foo.schema) with the schema extension
          into ${basedir}/src/schema.  If you opt to store it in another
          location you must override the <code>maven.eve.schema.dir</code>
          property in your project.properties file.   For each schema file
          add the file base name to the <code>maven.eve.schemas</code> property
          which is a comma separated list.
        </li>
        <li>
          The plugin will by default generate java files within the
          ${basedir}/target/schema directory.  If you would like to
          generate code elsewhere you must override the <code>
          maven.eve.schema.target.dir</code> property in your project.properties
          file.
        </li>
        <li>
          By default the plugin generates code in an Eve schema package:
          <code>org.apache.eve.schema.bootstrap</code>.  If you want
          generated code for a schema to be put into a package other than this,
          then you're going to need to set the package property for the schema.
          The package property key is composed of the following base, <code>
          maven.eve.schema.package.</code> with the name of the schema
          (<b>without</b> the extension) appended to it.  So for schema file
          foo.schema the following property key would be used: <code>
          maven.eve.schema.package.foo</code> where foo is the schema name.
        </li>
        <li>
          Using the same pattern above for all schema specific properties you
          can set other per schema properties as well.  One of these properties
          is the dependency list for a schema.  Schemas can obviously depend on
          others.  The schema dependency list is a comma separated list of other
          schema names.  These schemas need not be present in your project
          to generate the code for your schema.  The dependent schema classes
          must however be present within Eve at deploy time in order to load and
          use your schema.  At the end we list the the default schemas already
          packaged into the Eve jar.  You can use any one of these schemas as
          dependencies needed by your schema and not worry about their presence.
          The property key <b>base</b> for the schema dependency list is <code>
          maven.eve.schema.deps.</code> and for a foo.schema file the full key
          would be <code>maven.eve.schema.deps.foo</code>
        </li>
        <li>
          Each schema has an owner associated with it.  If you want the owner to
          be anything other than the Eve super user you may want to set the
          owner property for the schema in your project.properties file.  The
          property key base for the schema is <code>maven.eve.schema.owner.
          </code> so don't forget to append the schema name to it.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Once setup you can invoke maven to generate the schema sources like so:

      <p>
        The example above is from Eve.  If you would like to look at how to use
        this plugin best the Eve <a href="http://figwarra.notlong.com/">
        project.properties</a> file here is perhaps the best place to look.
        Also from the output above you can see the schema files that are used
        and packaged into Eve by default.  This may however change in the
        future to restrict the set.
      </p>

      <p>
        WARNING: As a last bit of advice make note that the plugin may be
        sensitive to case for keywords in the OpenLDAP file.  For example
        the prefix before an objectClass or an attributeType must be in all
        lowercase.  However words like MUST, and MAY and SUP should all be in
        uppercase.  So if plugin bombs just check out where this happens and
        play with the case.  Another thing to watch out for is the order of
        terms.  This we follow the RFC for which is pretty much the same as the
        OpenLDAP format minus the objectclass and attributetype prefixes to the
        descriptions.  We figure the OpenLDAP parser is less complex if the
        prefixes are there (where the parser is told if the description is an
        objectclass or attributetype and does not have to figure this out).
        However I have encountered schemas whose formats do not comply with
        standards in with respect to the order of description fields and had
        to edit the files.  This issue did not occur when the files were from
        the OpenLDAP Foundation which means they do it right but overlook
        schema objects that are not correctly formated.

    <section name="Server Authentication">
      <subsection name="Status">
        <p>
          Presently the directory server supports only simple authentication
          and anonymous binds while storing passwords in clear text within
          userPassword attributes in user entries.
        </p>

        <p>
          Within a short while we'll be able to store passwords using the
          authPassword property which uses strong one way hashes for
          authentication such as MD5 and SHA1.  These schemes and the schema
          used are described in detail here in <a href=
          "http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc3112.html">RFC 3112</a>.
        </p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="What password do I use?">
        <p>
          So you just downloaded the server and fired her up.  Now you're
          wondering how to get an LDAP client like jxplorer, gq, or ldapbrowser
          to bind to the server over the wire.
        </p>

        <p>
          By default the super user or admin account is created when the system
          partition is created under the ou=system naming context.  This occurs
          when the server is started for the first time.  The admin user can be
          found under the following DN:
        </p>

        <source>
          uid=admin,ou=system
        </source>

        <p>
          The password is initially set to <b>secret</b>.  You might want to
          change this after starting the server.  So you can bind to the server
          as this user with <b>secret</b> as the password for the first time.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you did not disable anonymous binds by setting the respective
          property (described below), then you can bind anonymously to the
          server without any username or password. NOTE: Even when anonymous
          binds are disabled anonymous users can still bind to the RootDSE
          as required by the protocol to lookup supported SASL mechanisms 
          before attempting a bind.
        </p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Adding and authenticating normal users">
        <p>
          A user in the server is any entry with a userPassword attribute that
          contains a clear text password.  The DN can be anything reachable
          within one of the directory partitions.  So if you add a partition to
          hang off of <code>dc=example,dc=com</code> then you can add user
          entries anywhere under this naming context or just add user entries
          under the <code>ou=system</code> naming context.  Below is an LDIF of
          a user you can add to the directory as a test user.
        </p>

        <source>
dn: uid=jdoe,ou=users,ou=system
cn: John Doe
sn: Doe
givenname: John
objectclass: top
objectclass: person
objectclass: organizationalPerson
objectclass: inetOrgPerson
ou: Human Resources
ou: People
l: Las Vegas
uid: jdoe
mail: jdoe@apachecon.comm
telephonenumber: +1 408 555 5555
facsimiletelephonenumber: +1 408 555 5556
roomnumber: 4613
userpassword: test
        </source>

        <p>
          You can download this <a href="newuser.ldif">newuser.ldif</a> file and
          use it to add the user.  If you are lazy another test user, <code>
          uid=akarasulu, ou=users, ou=system</code> already exists within the
          directory.  It is created by default.  Simply replace jdoe's DN with
          akarasulu's DN to search for this user and bind as this user.  Below
          we use the ldapadd OpenLDAP client to import the LDIF file presuming
          the server was started on port 1024 on the localhost:
        </p>

        <source>
ldapadd -a -D 'uid=admin,ou=system' -f newuser.ldif -h localhost -p 1024 -x -w secret
        </source>

        <p>
          You can confirm the add/import by performing a search for the user.
          This time using the OpenLDAP search client you use the following
          command:
        </p>

        <source>
ldapsearch -D 'uid=admin,ou=system' -h localhost -p 1024 -x -w secret -s one
    -b 'ou=users,ou=system' '(uid=jdoe)'
        </source>

        <p>
          You can start searching the directory using this new user like so:
        </p>

        <source>
ldapsearch -D 'uid=jdoe,ou=users,ou=system' -h localhost -p 1024 -x -w test -s one -b 'ou=system' '(objectClass=*)'
        </source>

      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Protecting User Passwords">
        <p>
          At the moment there's a sweet spot for new users.  This sweet
          spot is immediately under the ou=users,ou=system context.  Users
          created here are hard protected right now.  As of 0.9.3 an 
          implementation of X.501 basic access controls are available however
          the system is not turned on by default.  Turning it on presumes 
          access is denied to all but the admin.  More information on this is
          available in the access control page.  When the access control 
          subsystem is not activated hardcoded minimal access controls are
          used to protect the admin account, users and groups under respective
          containers in the ou=system partition. 
        </p>
        <p>
          In the absense of the ACI subsystem, authorization rules have been 
          hardcoded into the system to control access to user entries under 
          <code>ou=users,ou=system</code>.  Only the admin and the user 
          him/her self can access their entries for reads.  Users cannot 
          modify their group membership properties but can change their own 
          passwords.  They do not see each other's accounts at all.  The admin 
          is the only one that can read and write anything.
        </p>

        <p>
          So in the interim you're best off adding your users to this area to
          prevent others from reading clear text passwords stored in 
          userPassword fields.  If using a release with hashed passwords we 
          highly discourage the use of clear text passwords.
        </p>

        <p>
          Note that anonymous binds and binds as users show different
          views of the ou=system naming context.  So don't freak out if you
          don't see the usual suspects when binding anonymously!  Anonymous
          users cannot see the admin account or any other user accounts.  Users
          other than admin cannot see the admin account and can only see one
          user account: their own.  The admin sees everything and can alter or
          remove any entry.
        </p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Disabling Anonymous Binds">
        <p>
          Anonymous binds come enabled out of the box.  So you might want to
          turn off this feature especially if you're not using a version of 
          ApacheDS that is 0.9.3 or higher with ACI support. 
          To do so you're going to have to restart the server while disallowing
          these binds.  In the server.xml that comes with the distribution 
          take a look at the <b>allowAnonymousAccess</b> property for the
          server startup configuration.
        </p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Custom Authenticator">
        <p>
          Authenticator SPI provides a way to implement your own 
          authentication mechanism, for instance simple mechanism using 
          password encryption such as MD5 or SHA1, or SASL mechanism. See the 
          following example:
        </p>

        <source>
import javax.naming.NamingException;

import org.apache.ldap.server.auth.AbstractAuthenticator;
import org.apache.ldap.server.auth.LdapPrincipal;
import org.apache.ldap.server.jndi.ServerContext;
import org.apache.ldap.common.exception.LdapNoPermissionException;
import org.apache.ldap.common.name.LdapName;

public class MyAuthenticator extends AbstractAuthenticator {

    public MyAuthenticator( )
    {
        // create authenticator that will handle "simple" authentication mechanism
        super( "simple" );
    }

    public void init() throws NamingException
    {
        ...
    }

    public LdapPrincipal authenticate( ServerContext ctx ) throws NamingException
    {
        ...

        // return the authorization id
        LdapName principalDn = new LdapName( dn );
        return new LdapPrincipal( principalDn );
    }
}
          </source>

          <p>
            The authenticator class has to extend the 
            org.apache.ldap.server.auth.AbstractAuthenticator.  This class 
            needs to have a no-argument constructor that calls the super()
            constructor with parameter the authentication mechanism it is 
            going to handle.  In the above example, MyAuthenticator class is 
            going to handle the simple authentication mechanism. To implement 
            a SASL mechanism you need to call super() with the name of the 
            SASL mechanism, e.g. super( "DIGEST-MD5" ).
          </p>

          <p>
            You can optionally implement the init() method to initialize your 
            authenticator class.  This will be called when the authenticator 
            is loaded by ApacheDS during start-up.
          </p>

          <p>
            When a client performs an authentication, ApacheDS will call the 
            authenticate() method.  You can get the client authentication info 
            from the server context. After you authenticate the client, you 
            need to return the authorization id. If the authentication fails, 
            you should throw an LdapNoPermissionException.
          </p>

          <p>
            When there are multiple authenticators registered with the same 
            authentication type, ApacheDS will try to use them in the order 
            it was registered. If one fails it will use the next one, until it 
            finds one that successfully authenticates the client.
          </p>

          <p>
            To tell ApacheDS to load your custom authenticators, you need to 
            specify it in the server.xml. You can also optionally specify the 
            location of a .properties file containing the initialization 
            parameters. See the following example:
          </p>
